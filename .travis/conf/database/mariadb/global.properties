## global.properties
## -----------------
##
## In this file, you can manage all the same properties as uPortal.properties with one key
## difference:  this file may be sourced by uPortal modules (e,g, portlets) as well as by uPortal
## itself.  This file is an excellent place to manage configuration that is shared between uPortal
## and one or more modules (e.g. database connection settings).
##
##
## Please keep the formatting of this properties file as follows:
##
##   ##
##   ## Comment line 1
##   ## Comment line 2, etc
##   ##                     <-- (leave a blank commented line)
##   property_name=property_value
##                          <-- (leave a blank line...
##                          <--  or two blank lines before a new section)
##
## Leave properties that you do not wish to overrride commented-out with a single '#' and set to
## the default value (for reference).

## Not all modules bundled with uPortal require a database connection;  but all the ones that do use
## the same properties to connect.  These property names are standard for Hibernate-based
## persistence in Java projects.
##
## You can optionally configure any module to use different connection settings from the standard
## ones (defined here) by adding these properties to the module-specific file in portal.home
## (e.g. announcements.properties).
