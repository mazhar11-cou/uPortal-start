## notification.properties
## ------------------
##
## Use this file to override the default values of configuration settings.  All settings in the
## NotificationPortlet have a default value baked-into the build.  These defaults are suitable for a
## local development environment.  Place a copy of this file in your ${portal.home} directory and
## edit to taste.  The default value of ${portal.home} is '${catalina.base}/portal', but you can
## choose your own location by setting a PORTAL_HOME environment variable.
##
## Please keep the formatting of this properties file as follows:
##
##   ##
##   ## Comment line 1
##   ## Comment line 2, etc
##   ##                     <-- (leave a blank commented line)
##   property_name=property_value
##                          <-- (leave a blank line...
##                          <--  or two blank lines before a new section)
##
## Leave properties that you do not wish to overrride commented-out with a single '#' and set to
## the default value (for reference).

## DemoNotificationService
##
## Like the ClassLoaderResourceNotificationService -- of which it is an extension -- this data
## source reads notifications from the classpath in JSON format.  The DemoNotificationService
## additionally updates any dueDate fields it finds to points in time either slightly before or
## slightly after the present moment.
##
DemoNotificationService.locations=demo/demoNotificationResponse2.json,demo/demoNotificationResponse.json
