# IMPORTANT!  If you modify the value of either server.home or server.base, it is likely you will
# want to modify the other value as well.  The default value of server.base is NOT calculated from
# server.home.

# Location of the integrated Tomcat installation; e.g. server.home=${env.CATALINA_HOME}.  This
# property corresponds with the ${catalina.home} property within Tomcat (see Tomcat/bin/catalina.sh).

#server.home=

# (Optional) Base directory for resolving dynamic portions of the integrated Tomcat installation.
# This property corresponds with the ${catalina.base} property within Tomcat (see
# Tomcat/bin/catalina.sh).

# Location of Base Data Set;  base data is imported before entities specified
# in implementation.entities.location (below) and does not commonly require
# adopter customization.
#
#base.entities.location=

# Location of the Implementation Data Set;  entities in this folder should be
# heavily customized by adopters.  IMPORTANT!:  We recommend making a copy of
# the quickstart folder and changing this setting.

#implementation.entities.location=

# Location of the Performance Test Data Set;  entities in this folder can be
# generated via the perfGenTestData task
#
#data.test.perf.directory=

# Location (including filename ending in .csv) for the username and passwords
# of the created users. Default is `buildSrc/src/test/perf/baseline-population.csv`

# Number of users to generate.  Default is 1000
