# Adding Resources to Resource Server

uPortal supports the caching of static files in the Resource Server module.
While several JavaScript packages are included, you can add your own.

The following manual approach captures the actual static files in your repo.

## Check Existing Resources

To see what is currently including in `resource-server`, you can visit [https://github.com/Jasig/resource-server/tree/master/resource-server-content/src/main/webapp/rs](https://github.com/Jasig/resource-server/tree/master/resource-server-content/src/main/webapp/rs).

Alternately, you can simply look at the deployed `resource-server`'s `rs/` directory
in Tomcat's `webapps` directory.

Another approach to consider is using [WebJars](webjars.md). If the package does
not currently exist in `rs/`, check if there is a WebJar implementation. You can
find them at [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.webjars).

The [WebJars document](webjars.md) covers how to add webjars
to Resource Server via Gradle configuration over this manual approach.

There is also another version of Resource Server currently deployed with
`uPortal-start`. `ResourceServingWebapp` contains out-dated packages that
some uPortal components require. Again, look at your Tomcat deployment
to see what is actually available. ***Use of this module is discouraged.***

## Create `rs/` Directory

First step is to create an `rs/` directory in the Resource Server
overlay for your static content.

```sh
$ mkdir -p overlays/resource-server/src/main/webapp/rs
```

## Understand Naming Convention

Before adding static files, there is a naming convention that should be
followed.

Under `rs/`, the first level of directories are the names of the
packages. Some examples are `jquery`, `fontawesome`, `fetch`, `bootstrap`.

Under each package directory, directories matching versions follow.
For example, under `bootstrap`, you might find `2.3.2`, `3.0.0`, `3.1.1`, `3.3.5`.

Beyond the version directories, the file layout depends on the package.
Several packages will simply have the static files. Other packages may
have subdirectories like `css`, `img` and `js`.

## Add Static Files

Following the naming convention create appropriate directories and files.
As an example, here is how to add Backbone, version 1.3.3:

```sh
$ mkdir -p  overlays/resource-server/src/main/webapp/rs/backbone/1.3.3
$ cd overlays/resource-server/src/main/webapp/rs/backbone/1.3.3
$ unzip ~/Downloads/backbone-1.3.3.zip
$ ls -1
backbone-1.3.3.js
backbone-1.3.3.min.js
```

Our hypothetical `backbone-1.3.3.zip` has only these 2 files.

## Reference Static Files

These files will be available after the next deployment. These can be referenced
in JSPs, the most likely scenario.

For example:

```html
   <script src="/resource-server/rs/backbone/1.3.3/backbone-1.3.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"> </script>
```
