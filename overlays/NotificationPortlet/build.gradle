     * For uPortal 5 (and beyond), the Community Best Practice for WAR files published to Maven
     * Central is that they should *not* contain JDBC driver jars;  all such WAR files are
     * implemented locally by "overlaying" them, and it is the responsibility of they overlaying
     * project (here uPortal-start) to provide them with the appropriate drivers.  When the
     * published artifacts already contain drivers, the danger of conflicting versions is very
     * high.
     *
     * Nevertheless, earlier versions of uPortal and Apereo portlets *do* contain JDBC drivers,
     * specifically HSQLDB.  The following exclusion prevents the copy of this driver contained
     * within the published WAR file from being deployed.  Please remove this line when the
     * published artifact reliably omits the HSQLDB driver.
     *
     * See https://github.com/Jasig/uPortal-start/pull/120
